My game took inspiration from the space invader game.
A player spaceship will spawn in the bottom-middle of the screen.
Enemies will spawn at the top of the screen at random X coordinates.
The player will be able to shoot lasers at enemies.
Enemies will disappear if they collide with the lasers.
If the player touches any enemy ship then the game will end.
